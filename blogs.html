					<li>Helps a person acquire skills that increases his potential to gain better employment.</li>

<p><b>But more importantly, reading benefits in a myriad of ways including:</b></p>

<li>Literature is an art form that crosses barriers, helps people understand each other and utilize good judgment. In other words, reading encourages empathy.</li>
