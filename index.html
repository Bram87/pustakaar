				<p align="justify">“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.” ― Dr. Seuss, I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!</p>
				<p align="justify">Reading is an active mental process that promotes individual and collective progress and development. It triggers imagination, promotes quest for knowledge and activates healthy minds.Pustakaar aims at just that – <b>To activate healthy minds</b>.</p>
				<p align="justify">No child hates to read a book, but many don’t get an opportunity to get their hands on one. In our goal to promote literacy, we at Pustakaar simply want to start by taking a book to those children who don’t get to read one. Our mobile library is a treasure chest of books full of active imagination, which we aim to distribute amongst those children who are underprivileged and are in schools that lack the infrastructure to have a library. The idea of “borrowing” a book from a library for a whole week; holding, reading, devouring and dreaming with it over time, is to trigger positive mental development and engage in endless possibilities.</p>
				<p align="justify">Our goal is to let a child dive into a jungle, hop onto a cloud, ride on an elephant, join in an adventure, leap on mountains, turn into a fairy or a goblin and dream. Books tell stories that let kids travel with it. It shows a potential of a world that has a promise. It lights the lamp of hope and the fire of a desire to dream big. </p>
				<p align="justify">For us at Pustakaar, all it takes is a bus full of enthusiastic volunteers, inspiring books and school going kids who wait eagerly to hold that one book in their hand for a week before they get another one. Come join in our quest to activate healthy minds!</p>
